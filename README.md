# texi
Minimalist ascii text editor, an attempt to solve some
issues I had with other text editors.

## Usage
Open a text file with `texi <file>`. Type text to insert. 
Use arrows to move cursor, and hold shift while doing it
to change the selection. You can also move the cursor by
clicking on text, and change the selection by releasing
somewhere else. You can save changes by pressing `ctrl + s`,
copy with `ctrl + c`, and paste with `ctrl + c`. 

### Problems/caveats
- Pasting works fine, although copying is mostly broken,
save for within texi and a select few programs.
- When the screen redraws, there is some degree of flickering, hopefully not too much.
- texi lacks undo functionality, although this is not a bug.

## Installing
Compile using `make` or `make compile`, and then install
it to /usr/local/bin by running `make install` as root.

### Requirements
- xcb
- xcb-keysyms
- terminus font

## Thanks
- Thanks to to [jtanx](https://github.com/jtanx) for their [libclipboard](https://github.com/jtanx/libclipboard) library which I borrowed (stole) from.
- And also to Ã©tale-cohomology for their Stack Overflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72977399) about getting started with the clipboard.
