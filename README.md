# texi
Minimalist ascii text editor, an attempt to solve some
issues I had with other text editors.

## Usage
Open a text file with `texi <file>`. Type text to insert. 
Use arrows to move cursor, and hold shift while doing it
to change the selection. You can also move the cursor by
clicking on text, and change the selection by releasing
somewhere else. You can save changes by pressing `ctrl + s`,
copy with `ctrl + c`, cut with `ctrl + x`, and paste with `ctrl + v`. 

Please note that **texi lacks undo functionality, so changes are permanent**.

## Installing
Compile using `make` or `make compile`, and then install
it to /usr/local/bin by running `make install` as root.

### Requirements
- xcb
- xcb-keysyms
- terminus font for X

## Thanks
- Thanks to to [jtanx](https://github.com/jtanx) for their [libclipboard](https://github.com/jtanx/libclipboard) library which I borrowed (stole) from.
- And also to Ã©tale-cohomology for their Stack Overflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72977399) about getting started with the clipboard.
